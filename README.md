# 8×8 Wallace Tree Multiplier
This repository contains the implementation and testbench for an 8×8 unsigned Wallace multiplier in Verilog at the gate/structural level.

## 👨‍💻 Skills & Tools Demonstrated

- Digital design with structural Verilog
- RTL development for combinational circuits
- Testbench creation and verification
- Simulation and debugging (Vivado/ModelSim)
- Formal documentation (LaTeX)

## 🛠️ Features

- Fully structural 8×8 Wallace multiplier
- Modular Verilog subcomponents (ANDs, Half/Full Adders)
- Exhaustive waveforms for non-trivial test vectors
- Detailed report and gate count analysis
- Diagrams (hand-drawn/LaTeX)
